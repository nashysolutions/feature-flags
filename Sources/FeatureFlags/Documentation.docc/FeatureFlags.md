# ``FeatureFlags``

`FeatureFlags` is a Swift package for managing feature flags.  
It helps you conditionally enable features in your app based on the current version, with built-in support for user overrides and observable state.

This library is designed for teams who want to:

- Gradually roll out new functionality via [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
- Enable experimental features in pre-release builds
- Provide user-controlled feature toggles (e.g. via a debug menu)
