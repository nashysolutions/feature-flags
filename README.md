**FeatureFlags** is a lightweight, version-aware feature flag system for Swift applications.  
It enables you to define, register, and conditionally activate features based on semantic app versioning ‚Äî with support for user overrides, Combine observation, and testability.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Register and manage feature flags using `FeatureFlag` models
- üß† Evaluate feature availability using `SemanticVersion` from the [`Versioning`](https://github.com/nashysolutions/versioning) library.
- üïπÔ∏è Support user-controlled overrides (enable/disable) for pre-release builds.

## üì¶ Installation

Add this package via Swift Package Manager:

```swift
.product(name: "FeatureFlags", package: "feature-flags")
```

# Usage

1. Initialise the FeatureFlags Manager

```swift
let currentAppVersion = SemanticVersion(major: 1, minor: 0)
let flags = FeatureFlags(currentVersion: currentAppVersion)
```

2. Register Features

```swift
let onboarding = FeatureFlag(
    name: "OnboardingFlow",
    minimumVersion: "1.0.0",
    description: "Enables the new onboarding experience."
)

flags.registerFeature(onboarding)
```

3. Check Feature Availability

```swift
if flags.isFeatureEnabled("OnboardingFlow") {
    showNewOnboarding()
}
```

5. Observe Changes (e.g. via SwiftUI)

```swift
@ObservedObject var featureFlags: FeatureFlags

var body: some View {
    if featureFlags.enabledFeatures.contains(where: { $0.name == "SomeFeature" }) {
        NewUI()
    } else {
        OldUI()
    }
}
```
